Problem Statement

The Library Management System is a software solution that automates the processes involved in managing a library. The current manual system used by the library is time-consuming and prone to errors, which affects the efficiency of the library operations. The library staff spends a significant amount of time on tasks such as book issuing, record-keeping, and generating reports. The system also lacks real-time access to information, making it difficult for users to check the availability of books or for staff to keep track of the status of books. To address these challenges, a computerized Library Management System is needed that can automate the library processes, reduce errors, and provide real-time access to information. The system should allow users to search for books, place requests, check book availability, and borrow books. It should also provide staff with the ability to manage books, members. Overall, the system should be user-friendly, secure, and scalable to accommodate future growth. The Library Management System project aims to develop and implement a comprehensive software solution that will enhance the efficiency of the library operations and improve the user experience for both staff and users.
